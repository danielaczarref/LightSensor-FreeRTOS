# Light Sensor Project with FreeRTOS Arduino Kernel

## Objective

To light up a red LED when the ambient light lower than 20 from analog read of LDR sensor.

## Components

- Arduino UNO;
- USB;
- Protoboard;
- Jumpers;
- LDR Luminosity Sensor 5mm;
- 300 Ohm Resistor.

## Setup

### Case 1: Lights are ON and therefore analog read of LDR sensor is greater than 20 -> LED is OFF:
